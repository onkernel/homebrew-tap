This repository is a mirror of [kernel/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/kernel/homebrew-tap) maintained for backward compatibility with users who installed via `brew install onkernel/tap/kernel`.

This mirror is automatically synced from the upstream repository.

## Installation (New Users)

New users should install from the official tap:

```bash
brew install kernel/tap/kernel
```

brew untap onkernel/tap
brew install kernel/tap/kernel
```
